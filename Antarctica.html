   <p>This beautiful picture is one of the Antartic but it wont 
   be very beautiful for much longer if us human keep ondoing 
   what we are to harm this beautiful place, some of things 
   that we are doing are killing and disturbing spieces in the 
   antartic contamminating the soils and leaving rubbish and 
   other waste there to it and harm the Antarctic </p>

   <p>Humans neglecting the Antarctic have a big impact on not     just the animals that live there but also us humans, If 
   we keep neglecting the Antarctic and dont try to attempt 
   to stop our global warming problem it will keep melting 
   and will cause the oceans to rise which can affect a lot 
   of habitats which would affect how we eat and also our 
   susceptibility to illness </p>

   <p> We need to bind together as a world to help stop this 
   beautiful continent from just melting away. If we want to 
   help everyone will have to try and cut down there carbon 
   footprint so that the global temp will stop rising, and to 
   put a stop to hunting all of these beautiful spieces that 
   live there. </p>
